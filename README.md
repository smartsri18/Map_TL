# Map_TL
My first Android Application : **Map_TL**. This app fetches the location of the user, who may be your family member or friends based on the authenticated user email-ID into firebase database, if and only if that user shares or update their recent location to this application. Main objective of this appliaction is to track user's location and share that information only to trusted user.
